This project aims to compare the performance of basic CNN versus some alternatives in terms of:

- Time to train
- Loss
- Accuracy

Updates:

Oct 2nd: Basic CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.9803 at a loss of 0.0559. It took 179 minutes and 21 seconds to train this on a
Macbook air m1. Some further evaluation needs to be performed, such as k-fold, etc., before training the next architecture.
